                    Hello, and thank you for taking the time to visit my first
                    portfolio page. My name is Elizabeth and I have a background
                    in marketing and SEO optimization. My bachelorâ€™s degree is
                    in Journalism, and I have been in marketing for 10+ years.
                    Over the course of working for different companies, I
                    started coding and fell in love with it. Thank you for
                    visiting and helping my career transition.
                  </p>{" "}
